# Project Echo — AI Studio

**Status:** Active — AI Studio **v1.1** (Phase 1 baseline + FRAMEWORK-001 validation)  
**Date:** 2026-07-25  
**Validation:** [ValidationReport-FRAMEWORK-001.md](ValidationReport-FRAMEWORK-001.md)  

---

## Purpose

AI Studio is the development-workflow layer that helps Oscar, ChatGPT, and Cursor operate like a small professional game studio — without redesigning Project Echo’s game vision.

Phase 1 delivers **docs + Cursor infrastructure only** (no gameplay / uasset changes).

---

## Architecture Overview

```text
Documents (authority)
  ProductionPlaybook.md     ← process source of truth
  00_Governance/*           ← bibles adjacent, ADRs, contribution
  01–05_*                   ← design / tech / world / production / missions

.cursor/ (agent operating system)
  rules/*.mdc               ← always-on + scoped enforcement
  skills/*/SKILL.md         ← repeatable workflows
  agents/*.md               ← Task-tool role briefs (non-overlapping)
  hooks/                    ← optional; Phase 1 prefers docs (see Hooks.md)
  mcp.json                  ← Unreal MCP (leave alone unless required)
```

### Authority order (unchanged vision)

1. Story Bible  
2. Gameplay Design Bible  
3. Production Playbook (+ ContributionGuide naming)  
4. ADRs  
5. Mission Brief

## Skills Map

| Skill | Use when |
|-------|----------|
| `mission-planner` | Design plan first; wait for approval |
| `mission-implementer` | Approved brief → UE5 implement + report |
| `production-review-board` | Cross-role review before approve/merge |
| `documentation-sync` | Align docs / Changelog / indexes |
| `playtest-generator` | Manual PIE checklist for EP |

---

## Subagents

Role briefs in `.cursor/agents/` are prompt specs for Cursor’s Task tool. They are **not** a native Cursor “agents runtime.” Skills/rules reference them for Production Review Board and specialist reviews.

Duties are intentionally non-overlapping — see each brief’s Boundaries section.

---

## Reference Decisions (Phase 1)

| Decision | Rule |
|----------|------|
| Default production map recipe | **PE-018** (`LV_ARI_GeneratorAnnex` pattern) |
| Fuse path ownership | **PE-017A** (`LV_ARI_MaintenanceWing`) |
| Gameplay PASS | Human PIE (Enhanced Input) — Technical ≠ Gameplay |
